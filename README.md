My work on finding consumer sentiments through social media data

My focus here has been on finding consumer sentiments in a broad spectrum and the frequency of certain product-related details that are mixed in conversations and comments on social media. Using various predefined NLP libraries, I have been working on large and complex datasets to understand customer personas and the details of their conversations.
