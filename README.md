# Finding weak signals through NLP
This project was focused on finding weak signals in the gaming industry to understand what consumers were talking about the most and also to understand their sentiments towards the related topics.

My focus here has been on finding consumer sentiments in a broad spectrum and the frequency of certain product-related details that are mixed in conversations and comments on social media. Using various predefined NLP libraries, I have been working on large and complex datasets to understand customer personas and the details of their conversations.
